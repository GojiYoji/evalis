# Fablex

A polyglot, safe, user-friendly expression evaluator.

## How do you say that?

You can say "Fable-X" or "Fab-Lex". I don't really care.

## How to contribute?

1. Setup [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) - This manages the development environment
   and installing the correct tool versions. Once this is installed, run
   `mise install` in the project directory.
1. Run the following to setup your `python` environment and install the
   dependencies:

   ```shell
   mise install

   make setup_python
   ```
