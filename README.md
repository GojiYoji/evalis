## 🤝 How to Contribute?

### Prerequisites

1. Install [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) - This manages the development environment and tool versions.

### Setup

Once `mise` is installed, run the following from the project root:

```shell
# Install all required tools (Python, Node.js, etc.)
mise install

# Setup all language implementations
make setup
```

This will set up the development environment for all language implementations (Python, TypeScript, etc.).

### Building and Testing

```shell
# Build all implementations
make build

# Run all tests
make test

# Run all linters
make lint
```

For language-specific commands, see the individual language directories.
